- **Market Data**: Processes real-time market indicators
- **Portfolio State**: Considers current balance, PnL, and position data
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks win rates, drawdowns, and risk metrics

### Learning Process
1. **Initialization**: Trains on existing trade history at startup
2. **Signal Generation**: Uses trained models to predict optimal actions
3. **Outcome Learning**: Learns from each completed trade
4. **Adaptive Updates**: Adjusts model weights based on performance

## ðŸ”§ Integration Instructions

### Quick Integration
```python
# 1. Initialize AI learning at startup
from ai_standalone import initialize_standalone_ai_learning
initialize_standalone_ai_learning("simulation_data.json")

# 2. Replace signal detection
from ai_standalone import get_standalone_ai_signal
signal = get_standalone_ai_signal(market_data, trade_history, portfolio_data)

# 3. Learn from trade outcomes
from ai_standalone import learn_from_trade_standalone
learn_from_trade_standalone(signal, trade_outcome)
```
